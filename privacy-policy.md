# Data Collection and Use

Our Todo Extension is designed to provide users with an efficient way to manage tasks directly within their browser. We prioritize your privacy and ensure that no personal data is collected from our users. All tasks, status tags, progress dates, and other information managed through the extension are stored locally within your browser. This means that none of your data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers. We have no access to the data you store using the extension, ensuring complete privacy and control over your information.

# Data Storage and Access

The Todo Extension utilizes your browserâ€™s local storage to save and manage your tasks. This approach ensures that your data remains on your device and is not accessible by us or any other external entities. We do not access, track, or store any of your personal information or tasks. As a result, you can rest assured that your task data remains private and secure, accessible only to you through your own browser. Our commitment is to provide you with a powerful and private task management tool that respects your privacy and data security.
